      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Naveen Porwal</span>, a Data Scientist/Reporting Manager at Merck Bangalore, specializing in the field of AI and automation. My main area of focus is Supervise/reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of <span class="highlight">generalized persistent monitoring</span> by a team of cooperative multi-agent systems.</p> 
      
      <p>My work is applied to a range of real-world problems, helping to optimize risks, resources, timelines, budgets, and performance. Automated systems must work together in real-time to ensure effective monitoring.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I completed both my <strong>Bachelor's</strong> and <strong>Master's</strong> in Mathematics at IMT Ghaziabad. During my Master's thesis, I worked on <span class="highlight">theoretical high-data Match</span> and its intersection with <span class="highlight">machine learning</span>. This foundational work set the stage for my current research interests in applied machine learning and robotics.</p>
      
      <p>I am driven by a passion for <span class="highlight">learning and technology</span>. Whether it's coding, experimenting with new AI techniques, or diving into the latest advancements in machine learning, I thrive in the world of innovation. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy cycling, playing Cricket, and learning new languages to expand my horizons.</p>
      
      <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Every day is an opportunity for improvement. I strive to be a better version of myself today than I was yesterday. Whether it's improving my research, exploring new technologies, or simply growing as a person, I believe in constant self-improvement and learning.</p>

      <p>When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, you can find me cycling through scenic paths, playing Cricket with friends, or experimenting with new languages and skills to stay sharp.</p>
