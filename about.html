  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>This is the about page for my website. You can write details about yourself or your work here.

  I am a Ph.D. researcher in the domain of robotics and automation at IISER Bhopal. My specialization is in the area of multi-agent reinforcement learning. In particular, I am interested in the problem of generalized persistent monitoring by a team of cooperative multi-agent systems that arises in several applications like border patrol and security.

For this thesis topic, I have been nominated and awarded the Prime Minister Research Fellowship (PMRF)

Previously, I had completed my Bachelors and Masters in Physics from IISER Bhopal. I worked in the domain of theoretical high-energy physics and machine learning as part of my Masters thesis.

I am fuelled by the passion and desire for learning. I am passionate about software, computers, and technology. I love cycling, playing Basketball, and learning new spoken languages in my free time. I strive to be a better version of myself today than what I was yesterday.
